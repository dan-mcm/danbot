# Twitch Integration

## ðŸ”´ Now Live
The bot can provide going live messages for whitelisted users.

* `NOWLIVE_ANNOUNCEMENTS_ID` controls the channel where live twitch channels are now active

In order to maintain a dynamic updatable whitelist integration with Google Sheets is required.  
This can be configured through the following env variables.

* `WHITELIST_SPREADSHEET_ID`
* `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`
* `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY`
* `GOOGLE_SPEADSHEET_URL`

To get setup with a google service account follow the [official guidelines](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account). Be sure to share your Google Spreadsheet to your GOGOEL_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL to avoid hitting 401/403 errors.


Note: the bot is currently configured to poll Twitch API on a 3 minute interval (defined by the `TWITCH_POLLING_FREQUENCY` environmental variable so there may be a delay between the time a user goes live and a message is shown. If interested a potential alternative to this implementation is using [Twitchs pub/sub system](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/pubsub).

### Discord Bot Variables

For Discord Bot settings (`BOT_PREFIX`, `BOT_TOKEN`) - check out the handy [discordpy docs](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html) on how to set up your own Bot application.  
The `EMBED_COLORS` variable is a HEX color used for determining the color of message embeds (cards) sent by the Bot.

* For `WELCOME_CHANNEL` you need to specify a channel name within your discord server to use for new user addition welcome.
* For `NOWLIVE_ANNOUNCEMENTS_ID` see the official Discord [docs](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) on how to get a specific channels channel-id
* For `PLAYLIST_CHANNEL` and `PLAYLIST_VOICE_CHANNEL_ID` see the official Discord [docs](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) on how to get a specific voice channels channel-id
* For `PLAYLIST_TEXT_CHANNEL` and `PLAYLIST_TEXT_CHANNEL_ID` see the official Discord [docs](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) on how to get a specific voice channels channel-id

### Getting API Keys

* For `CAT_API_KEY` you need to [register with TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/) to obtain an API key.
* For `GIPHY_API_KEY` you need to [register with GIPHY](https://developers.giphy.com/) to obtain an API key.  
* For `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` variables check the [Twitch API docs](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication).
* For `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` you need to [register with Google](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started) to obtain an API key.

## Audio Dependencies

You need ffmpeg installed on your device to successfully have the bot join and translate youtube to audio files.  
You can get the downloadable executables from [here](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and should copy the relevant .exe file into this projects directory.

Without it you are likely to encounter the following Error when running any of the playback commands.

```
Error: FFmpeg/avconv not found!
```

# Production Deployment

The Bot is currently configured for deployment on Heroku (as an initial free hosting solution).
There is a nice [medium article](https://medium.com/@mason.spr/hosting-a-discord-js-bot-for-free-using-heroku-564c3da2d23f) on how to deploy your own.

As we are using a .env file to generate global environmental variables, we need to be sure to copy and
paste these values into the applications 'Config Vars' on the Heroku dashboard.

In order to workaround the audio dependencies issues I am trailing the use of .buildpacks to use https://github.com/jonathanong/heroku-buildpack-ffmpeg-latest.git. Note the ordering of buildpacks is important on your Heroku dashboard, the ffmpeg should be ran first, followed by the nodejs buildpack.

Currently the repo is configured to redeploy the app with any pushes made to the master branch.
In order to review production logs you need to [download & install the heroku cli tooling](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install).

```
heroku login
heroku logs -a danbot2020 -t
```

The current bot url is currently accessible at `https://danbot2020.herokuapp.com/` with a `/health` endpoint that returns a 200 OK response.
Note that you need to add your hosting URL as a valid OAuth Redirect URL entry on your registered Twitch application.

Want to temporarily turn off/on the bot?

```
# scale down
heroku ps:scale web=0 -a danbot2020
# scale up
heroku ps:scale web=1 -a danbot2020
```
